Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::HTML::PopupRadio.

1.16  Sun Feb 21 12:55:00 2010
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.

1.15  Wed Feb 10 14:01:48 2010
	- MANIFEST.SKIP updated to exclude MYMETA.yml. Add MYMETA.yml.

1.14  Fri Nov 13 13:20:00 2009
	- Run dos2unix
	- Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES

1.13  Wed Mar 22 10:57:00 2006
	- In subs popup_menu and radio_group, use a case-insensitive compare when trying to set the default menu item.
		I need this in one project because the menu values and the default come from different databases

1.12  Mon Dec 12 13:18:00 2005
	- In sub popup_menu(), check the caller has set a default value before trying to use the default.
		This stops an 'uninitialized' warning being emitted
	- Add more patterns to MANIFEST.SKIP

1.11  Wed Nov  9 15:38:00 2005
	- Add a new parameter to new() and set(): options.
		This takes a hash ref as its value, and allows you to specify any list of options
		you wish to add to the HTML of the 'select'. Eg:
			With new(name => 'a_name', ...), the 'select' would look like:
			<select id = "a_name" name = "a_name">
			With new(name => 'a_name', options => {tabindex => 2, force => 1}, ...),
			the 'select' would look like:
			<select id = "a_name" name = "a_name" tabindex = "2" force = "1">
	- Make this module depend on HTML::Entities::Interpolate so we can output any text
		by calling HTML::Entities::encode_entities when appropriate

1.10  Mon Feb 14 20:08:00 2005
	- Extend the flexibility of the 'prompt' option, to allow it to point to an anonymous
		hash, so you can specify a set of strings, and their corresponding values, to be output
		at the top of the menu. The default behaviour is identical to the previous version.
		Original patch by Sean McKenna
	- Update docs

1.09  Mon Jul 19 14:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Delete ./test.pl
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.08  Mon Jun  3 19:48:00 2003
	- Change the option 'prompt', which can be used to set the first selection in pop-up menus,
		so that it is either a string (as it was originally), or a hash ref (new in this version).
		Hence we can say new(prompt => 'Choose one') or new(prompt => {'0' => 'Choose one'}).
		In the first case, the string 'Choose one' is both a visible menu item and the value
		passed back to the CGI script if the user selects that item.
		In the new case, the string 'Choose one' is the visible menu item, and the other value,
		here '0', is the one passed back to the CGI script. In particular, this works -
		new(prompt => {'' => 'Choose one'}) - to return the empty string to the CGI script.

1.07  Mon Apr 28 21:31:00 2003
	- Backticks with redirection of STDERR failed in Module::MakeDist V 1.04 when making
		V 1.06 of this module, so I've had to re-make then both

1.06  Mon Apr 28 09:09:00 2003
	- The constructor now takes a 'javascript' parameter, whose value is, say, an event handler
	- A sample would be: 'onChange = "replicate()"'. See the POD for details

1.05  Sun Mar 23 11:29:00 2003
	- No source code changes in this version
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.

1.04  Wed Dec 11 12:53:57 2002
	- Minor documentation changes. No need to upgrade

1.03  Mon Nov 18 12:53:57 2002
	- Fix sub radio_group so that if there is no default,
		the items are counted, and the first becomes the default.
		This was the plan all along, but it was so clear in my
		mind I did not transfer the logic to the code

1.02  Sat Oct 26 14:29:00 2002
	- Minor documentation changes. No need to upgrade

1.01  Tue Oct 15 11:41:13 2002
	- Change the meaning of the 'default' parameter so it refers
		to the visible menu item and not the value associated with
		the visible menu item. This now matches the meaning of the
		'default' parameter used in DBIx::HTML::ClientDB
	- Add a primitive test program t/test.t
	- Minor documentation changes

1.00  Sat Sep 28 12:37:29 2002
	- original version
