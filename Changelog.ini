Comments= <<EOT
- In subs popup_menu and radio_group use a case-insensitive compare when trying to set the default menu item.
I need this in one project because the menu values and the default come from different databases

Date=2005-12-12T13:18:00
Comments= <<EOT
- In sub popup_menu() check the caller has set a default value before trying to use the default.
This stops an 'uninitialized' warning being emitted
- Add more patterns to MANIFEST.SKIP

[V 1.11]
Date=2005-11-09T15:38:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add a new parameter to new() and set(): options.
This takes a hash ref as its value and allows you to specify any list of options
you wish to add to the HTML of the 'select'. Eg:
With new(name => 'a_name' ...) the 'select' would look like:
<select id = "a_name" name = "a_name">
With new(name => 'a_name' options => {tabindex => 2 force => 1} ...)
the 'select' would look like:
<select id = "a_name" name = "a_name" tabindex = "2" force = "1">
- Make this module depend on HTML::Entities::Interpolate so we can output any text
by calling HTML::Entities::encode_entities when appropriate

[V 1.10]
Date=2005-02-14T20:08:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Extend the flexibility of the 'prompt' option to allow it to point to an anonymous
hash so you can specify a set of strings and their corresponding values to be output
at the top of the menu. The default behaviour is identical to the previous version.
Original patch by Sean McKenna
- Update docs

[V 1.09]
Date=2004-07-19T14:43:00

- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
- Delete ./test.pl
- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

[V 1.08]
Date=2003-06-03T19:48:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Change the option 'prompt' which can be used to set the first selection in pop-up menus
so that it is either a string (as it was originally) or a hash ref (new in this version).
Hence we can say new(prompt => 'Choose one') or new(prompt => {'0' => 'Choose one'}).
In the first case the string 'Choose one' is both a visible menu item and the value
passed back to the CGI script if the user selects that item.
In the new case the string 'Choose one' is the visible menu item and the other value
here '0' is the one passed back to the CGI script. In particular this works -
new(prompt => {'' => 'Choose one'}) - to return the empty string to the CGI script.

- Backticks with redirection of STDERR failed in Module::MakeDist V 1.04 when making
V 1.06 of this module so I've had to re-make then both

[V 1.06]
Date=2003-04-28T09:09:00
Comments= <<EOT
- The constructor now takes a 'javascript' parameter whose value is say an event handler
- A sample would be: 'onChange = "replicate()"'. See the POD for details
EOT

[V 1.05]
Date=2003-03-23T11:29:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No source code changes in this version
- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros because the
PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro
which means it does not index the module and this in turn means
the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list etc.

Date=2002-12-11T12:53:57
Comments=- Minor documentation changes. No need to upgrade

[V 1.03]
Date=2002-11-18T12:53:57
Comments= <<EOT
- Fix sub radio_group so that if there is no default
the items are counted and the first becomes the default.
This was the plan all along but it was so clear in my
mind I did not transfer the logic to the code
EOT

[V 1.02]
Date=2002-10-26T14:29:00
Comments=- Minor documentation changes. No need to upgrade

[V 1.01]
Date=2002-10-15T11:41:13
Comments= <<EOT
- Change the meaning of the 'default' parameter so it refers
to the visible menu item and not the value associated with
the visible menu item. This now matches the meaning of the
'default' parameter used in DBIx::HTML::ClientDB
- Add a primitive test program t/test.t
- Minor documentation changes
